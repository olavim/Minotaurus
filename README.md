# Minotaurus
### A CS practical work. 

A work comparing the performance of AIs in mazes when their goals and inner workings (searching algorithms) differ.
Coincidentally, the project will also contain maze generation algorithms, though it will not be the focus of this
work. If much free time remains after the work is mainly done, I might consider different algorithms for maze generation
as well.

Documentation of this project will be written in English, with the exception of docs existing solely for this course's bookkeeping, such as time tracking (how much time I spent doing what), which will be in Finnish.
