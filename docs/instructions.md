#### Maze Generator

Maze Generator is the component that generates the playfield. The playfield might be an empty arena, having walls only in the edges of the field. It might be a maze with complex paths from one point to another. Whatever it is, the chosen maze generator determines how the field is constructed.

To choose a maze generator, click on the menu icon on the right edge below the **Maze Generator** label.
